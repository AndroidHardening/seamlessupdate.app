            <h1>Hardened Android Open Source Project releases</h1>
            <p>These are early sample releases of a privacy and security hardened variant of the
            Android Open Source Project. These are not meant to be suitable for production
            yet. For now, this primarily includes the
            <a href="https://github.com/AndroidHardening/hardened_malloc/blob/master/README.md">new
            hardened memory allocator</a> and other smaller changes. The project will be
            subtantially expanded in scope as more resources become available.</p>
            <p>The sources are available via the
            <a href="https://github.com/AndroidHardening/platform_manifest">manifest on GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>Bitcoin donations can be sent to 3QpKs45BLXirWAgYtV1sTCbAkfUe7HByR5 to support the
            project.</p>
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
            <p>You should have at least 2GB of free memory available.</p>
            <p>You need the unlocked variant of one of the supported devices, not a locked carrier
            specific variant.</p>
            <p>You need an updated copy of the <code>fastboot</code> tool and it needs to be
            included in your <code>PATH</code> environment variable. You can run <code>fastboot
            --version</code> to determine the current version. It should be at least
            <code>28.0.0</code>. Don't proceed with the installation process until this is set up
            properly in your current shell. A very common mistake is using an outdated copy of
            <code>fastboot</code> from a Linux distribution package not receiving regular updates.
            Make sure that the <code>fastboot</code> found earliest in your <code>PATH</code> is
            the correct one if you have multiple copies on your system. You can run <code>which
            fastboot</code> to determine where the tool being used is coming from. Older versions
            do not have support for current devices, and particularly old versions from several
            years ago still shipped in current packages by some Linux distributions like Debian
            lack detection for compatibility and may soft brick the device.</p>
            <h3>Enabling OEM unlocking</h3>
            <p>OEM unlocking needs to be enabled from within the operating system.</p>
            <p>Enable the developer settings menu by going to Settings -> System -> About phone
            and pressing on the build number menu entry until developer mode is enabled.</p>
            <p>Next, go to Settings -> System -> Advanced -> Developer settings and toggle on the
            'Enable OEM unlocking' setting.</p>
            <h3>Unlocking the bootloader</h3>
            <p>First, boot into the bootloader interface. You can do this by turning off the
            device and then turning it on by holding both the Volume Down and Power buttons.</p>
            <p>The bootloader now needs to be unlocked to allow flashing new images:</p>
            <pre>fastboot flashing unlock</pre>
            <p>The command needs to be confirmed on the device.</p>
            <h3>Obtaining factory images</h3>
            <p>The initial install will be performed by flashing the factory images. This will
            replace the existing OS installation and wipe all the existing data.</p>
            <p>You can download the factory images from the bottom of this page.</p>
            <p>Verify the official factory images using the GPG signature:</p>
            <pre>gpg --recv-keys 65EEFE022108E2B708CBFCF7F9E712E59AF5F22A
gpg --verify blueline-factory-2018.12.21.18.zip.sig blueline-factory-2018.12.21.18.zip</pre>
            <p>When this signing key is replaced, the new key will be signed with it.</p>
            <h3>Flashing factory images</h3>
            <p>Next, extract the factory images and run the script to flash them. Note that the
            <code>fastboot</code> command run by the flashing script requires a fair bit of free
            space in a temporary directory, which defaults to <code>/tmp</code>:<p>
            <pre>unzip blueline-factory-2018.12.21.18.zip
cd blueline-pq1a.181205.006
./flash-all.sh</pre>
            <p>Use a different temporary directory if your <code>/tmp</code> doesn't have enough
            space available:</p>
            <pre>mkdir tmp
TMPDIR="$PWD/tmp" ./flash-all.sh</pre>
            <p>Wait for the flashing process to complete and for the device to boot up using the
            new operating system.</p>
            <p>You should now proceed to locking the bootloader before using the device as locking
            wipes the data again.</p>
            <h3>Locking the bootloader</h3>
            <p>Locking the bootloader is important as it enables full verified boot. It also prevents using
            fastboot to flash, format or erase partitions.  Verified boot will detect modifications to any of
            the OS partitions (vbmeta, boot/dtbo, system, vendor) and it will prevent reading any modified /
            corrupted data. If changes are detected, error correction data is used to attempt to obtain the
            original data at which point it's verified again which makes verified boot robust to non-malicious
            corruption.</p>
            <p>Reboot into the bootloader menu and set it to locked:</p>
            <pre>fastboot flashing lock</pre>
            <p>The command needs to be confirmed on the device since it needs to perform a factory
            reset.</p>
            <p>Unlocking the bootloader again will perform a factory reset.</p>
            <h3>Disabling OEM unlocking</h3>
            <p>OEM unlocking can be disabled again in the developer settings menu within the
            operating system after booting it up again.</p>
            <h3>Reverting to stock</h3>
            <p>These factory images flash a non-stock Android Verified Boot key which needs to be
            erased to fully revert back to a stock device setup. After flashing the stock factory
            images and before locking the bootloader, you should erase the custom Android Verified
            Boot key to untrust it:</p>
            <pre>fastboot erase avb_custom_key</pre>
            <p>To confirm that the key is unset, verify that
            <code>avb_user_settable_key_set</code> is <code>no</code>:</p>
            <pre>fastboot getvar avb_user_settable_key_set</pre>
